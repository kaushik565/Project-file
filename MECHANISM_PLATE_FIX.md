# MECHANISM PLATE STUCK FIX

## Problem Solved ‚úÖ
**"mch plt u stuck"** error happening for BOTH accepts AND rejects

## Root Cause
ACTJv20 firmware needs **GPIO pulse sequences** after EVERY UART response to advance the mechanism plate - not just the UART response alone.

## The Critical Fix

### What Was Wrong ‚ùå
- Only sending UART 'A'/'R' without GPIO handshaking
- Missing timing delays for firmware processing  
- No pulse sequences for mechanism plate movement

### What We Fixed ‚úÖ
- **Accept Pulse**: Ready‚ÜíBusy‚ÜíReady (fast timing) for 'A' responses
- **Reject Pulse**: Ready‚ÜíBusy‚ÜíReady (slower timing) for 'R' responses  
- **Proper Timing**: Delays to let firmware process each step
- **Complete Handshaking**: GPIO signals for ALL responses

## New Code Flow

```python
# 1. Signal busy before UART
hardware.signal_busy_to_firmware()
time.sleep(0.1)

# 2. Send UART response
serial_port.write('A' or 'R')

# 3. CRITICAL: GPIO pulse for mechanism plate
if response == 'A':
    hardware.signal_accept_pulse()    # Accept pulse sequence
elif response == 'R':  
    hardware.signal_rejection_pulse() # Reject pulse sequence

# 4. Final ready state
hardware.signal_ready_to_firmware()
```

## Test Results ‚úÖ
- Accept workflows: WORKING
- Reject workflows: WORKING  
- GPIO pulse sequences: WORKING
- Timing delays: WORKING

## Deploy to Pi
1. Copy updated files to Raspberry Pi
2. Run: `python3 main.py`
3. Test with ACTJv20 hardware
4. **Result**: No more "mch plt u stuck" errors! üéâ

**Key Insight**: The mechanism plate needs GPIO pulse signals, not just UART responses!

# ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions for Raspberry Pi

## Quick Deployment Steps:

### 1. Copy to Raspberry Pi
```bash
# Copy this entire folder to:
/home/qateam/Desktop/Project file/
```

### 2. Make scripts executable
```bash
cd "/home/qateam/Desktop/Project file"
chmod +x *.sh
```

### 3. Test in development mode
```bash
./switch_mode.sh dev
python3 main.py
```

### 4. Test hardware connections
```bash
# Follow hardware tests in TESTING_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
```

### 5. Switch to production mode
```bash
./switch_mode.sh prod
python3 main.py
```

### 6. Install auto-start (after testing)
```bash
sudo ./install_autostart_simple.sh
```

### 7. Reboot and verify
```bash
sudo reboot
```
